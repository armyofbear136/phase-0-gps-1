#Release 7: Reflect
What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
	- I was not entirely familiar with the syntax for merging a branch
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
	- Conflicts!
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
	- No questions this time
What still confuses you about Git?
	- We use git in case we make a mistake... Still don't know how to roll back!
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
	- Well as I didn't make it to my GPS, I'd say it went well. I understand the material and the workflow was simple.
